        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, My name is Melanie Ruiz. Thank you for taking time to visit my website. I am currently an undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside. As of now I am a sophomore Chass Undeclared major focusing on studying psychology. I have not yet had a job, but I have spent years participating in community service. Some of these instances include organizing, setting up, and working with a school nearby in order to create a fall festival for the school. I believe that this experience gave me leadership skills as I had to partake in organizing the entire event. Most of the time, I was alone trying to make sure that everything was going smoothly. Another community service event that I participated in was working in the office at my school for a couple of months. Here I gained experience as to what a typical day would be like for someone who works in an office. I also got to organize files, answer phone calls, etc. I believe that although I have had official job experience already, that these couple of months working with someone who works at an office at a school really helped me gain many skills that will help me in the future.
 <br><br>

        Another experience that I believe was beneficial and important to me would be partaking in my school's community service club. I would frequently go to many of the events which included cleanups, organizing events, and working at homeless shelters. In this club I got to work with many different people including other school peers in the club, teachers, and organizers of the community service events that I had attended. I was in this club for around 2 years and I would frequently volunteer as much as I could. Like I said before, I may not have had any official job experiences yet, but I do believe that this club really helped me gain skills that I believe I could have got at other jobs. I learned how to discuss with people, how to organize events, how to work at events, etc. 
<br><br>

        Another experience that I have had would be becoming a leader in my club called ‚Äúlink crew‚Äù. In this club I was a leader who helped many incoming freshmen navigate their way through freshman year. In this club not only did I have to become a leader and be in charge of multiple freshmen, but I also had to partake in many of the club's events. Therefore, I had to communicate with my peers and many teachers and I had to organize events. I also had to input my own advice into some of these events at times. One of the most important things from this event in my life would be being in charge of many different freshmen and helping them reach their goals. I am very grateful for the opportunities that I have had and I believe that all of these events have helped me gain skills and knowledge that will help me reach my goals in the future.
